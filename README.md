# Frontend Web Developer Code Test

Remove the box-sizing properties from the css/styles.css file.  This will cause the boxes (sections) within the main body section to break.  Ask your potential code developer to fix tho boxes to complete.

Judge developer on diagnosis time and code quality.  CSS should be overridden versus changed.  Further, the only necessary changes needed to fix the page is to add box-sizing to the proper elements.
